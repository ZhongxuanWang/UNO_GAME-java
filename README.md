# UNO_GAME-java
The realization of an UNO card game using java. (This project is for Saint Andrew's School CSA class). 
<br>**This project will play around java hiarachy (CSA Unit9)**
<br>**This project is not about the practice of GUI (solely console output) so there would be no GUI in this UNO project. If you want to familiarize with JFrame, checkout my SharpCharGrapher project under my repo.**
